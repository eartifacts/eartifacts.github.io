&ldquo;Monday Morning Quarterbacks&rdquo; is the penultimate track from [Off
Minor](/artists/off-minor)&rsquo;s (one of two major bands formed in the wake
of [Saetia](/artists/saetia)&rsquo;s demise, the other being [Hot
Cross](/artists/hot-cross)) debut full-length. It is effectively the ultimate
track, as the following track is a brief solo guitar rendition of [Monk&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Off Minor&rdquo;][off-minor], entirely different from the full-band
[emo](/genres/emo) of the rest of the album.

## Theme

This tune is not **quite** monothematic, strictly speaking, but is nevertheless
in a broadly theme-and-variations form. The first two bars set the theme; here
is a rough transcription of those two bars, with repeat signs showing how it is
repeated:
